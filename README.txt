==========

This module allows developers to easily change some basic field settings.
If you do not know what you're doing with this module... then don't use it!
Changing field settings can easily break your site if you don't know what you're doing.

Some use cases:
- You may need to "unlock" a locked field.
- You may need to change a value in the settings array.
- You need to change a field's settings, but you'd rather not go through the DB.

TODO:
- Add ability to add/remove items in an array.
- Add ability to add/remove arrays.
- Add ability to edit the "key" value.
